Azure Databricks - Project Course

The primary focus of the course is Azure Databricks and Spark core, but it also covers the relevant concepts and connectivity to the other technologies mentioned. Please note that the course doesn't cover other aspects of Spark such as Spark streaming and Spark ML. Also the course has been taught using PySpark as well as Spark SQL; It doesn't cover Scala or Java.

The course follows a logical progression of a real world project implementation with technical concepts being explained and the Databricks notebooks being built at the same time. Even though this course is not specifically designed to teach you the skills required for passing the Azure Data Engineer Associate Certification Exam DP203, it can greatly help you get most of the necessary skills required for the exam.
